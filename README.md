Self Lacing Sneaker

A self lacing sneaker protoype comprised of 3D printed parts and Arduino.

I will be making a self lacing sneaker prototype. The system will be very barebones, using a stepper motor it will cynch a representation of a sneaker upper tight.

The lacing component will use both a pressure sensor and a button. the pressure sensor will tell the sneaker when to tighten and the button will loosen.

Components will be: stepper motor, worm gear, lace, "midsole", "upper", battery pack, cynch

Describe the components, or pieces, that make up your project.

Include what types of inputs/outputs/data it will use. You can also upload an image with a diagram showing how all those pieces are connected.

## When your project is completed, you will then add the following sections:
