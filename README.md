## Self Lacing Sneaker

A self lacing sneaker protoype comprised of 3D printed parts and Arduino.

I will be making a self lacing sneaker prototype. The system will be very barebones, using a stepper motor it will cynch a representation of a sneaker upper tight.

The lacing component will use two buttons and a stepper moter. One button, placed in the heel of the sneaker, will tighten the strap when stepped on. The other button will loosen the strap when pressed.

The main interactions and inputs are the tightening and loosening buttons.

Components will be: stepper motor, 3D printed couplers, strap, 3D printed "midsole", wall power, cynch.

## Timeline

- Week 1: Write Proposal, flush out initial code for your idea
- Week 2: Continue to write code
- Week 3: Cad and 3D print parts and finalize code
- Week 4: Present!

## Challenges

The main challenge was getting the stepper to work. Unfortunatly the only steppers available at the Hybrid Lab were very powerful, and require a wall plug along with power from my computer to run.
