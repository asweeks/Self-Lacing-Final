## Self Lacing Sneaker

A self lacing sneaker protoype comprised of 3D printed parts and Arduino.

I will be making a self lacing sneaker prototype. The system will be very barebones, using a stepper motor it will cynch a representation of a sneaker upper tight.

The lacing component will use two buttons. One button, placed in the heel of the sneaker, the sneaker when to tighten and the button will loosen.

Components will be: stepper motor, 3D printed couplers, strap, 3D printed "midsole", wall power, cynch

Include what types of inputs/outputs/data it will use. You can also upload an image with a diagram showing how all those pieces are connected.

## When your project is completed, you will then add the following sections:
## Timeline

What did you do in each of the past four weeks?

- Week 1: Write Proposal, flush out initial code for your idea
- Week 2: Continue to write code
- Week 3: Cad and 3D print parts and finalize code

- Week 4: Present!
 
## Challenges

The main challenge was getting the stepper to work. Unfortunatly the only steppers availe
